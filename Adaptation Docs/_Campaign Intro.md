Each player will introduce their character by telling us what their character was up to when they opened a door into a library…

Once that’s done, i’ll take over and explain what they experience when the door opens: 

- The floor falls out from underneath them, the entire room they were stepping into is being pulled somewhere, piece by piece. 
    
- As they begin falling sideways, they are pelted by hundreds of books and bookshelves. Have everyone make a DC15 Dexterity saving throw. Anyone that fails falls unconscious. 
    
- PCs that succeed on their save see themselves thrown to the ground in a heap alongside the PCs that weren’t able to avoid being knocked out. The unconscious characters are under a pile of books and debris…
    
- While the PCs are gathering their thoughts / saving the KO’d characters…they feel a whoosh of air and see a few books fall off a pile nearby. Make a DC12 perception check. On a success: the PCs notice a pair of spectral wings and a tail disappearing into a row of bookshelves…more on that later
    
The room the PCs find themselves in is quite the sight. From where they’re standing, it appears to be a library of unusual size and shape. There are bookshelves stacked floor to ceiling in all sorts of orientations. The stacks look like they could fall over at any minute. The PCs are currently in an area of the library that appears to be under construction? There are a multitude of stacks of books amongst the piles, as well as a couple bookshelves that aren’t completely full. 

When the PCs begin investigating what they saw, or enough time passes, they will run into the source of the disturbance…[[Miirym]] the spirit dragon. [[Miirym]] may interrupt the PCs if they take too long to wake each other up, or if the entire party is knocked out.

If the party looks around for interesting books, or asks [[Miirym]] if she’s found any that are out of the ordinary, she’ll bring them a huge leatherbound book with a clasped lock. The mechanism is damaged, but the book can be opened again by pulling hard on the clasp. 

[[Miirym]] will remember that there were some different folks here a while back that were messing with this book! She hasn’t seen them in quite a while though…wonder what happened to them?

As the party begins reading the book, they quickly realize it’s the memoir of an ancient wizard named Fistandia who retired to a wonderful mansion with her pet cat…they are whisked away into the story! An illustration of a set of double doors animates in front of their eyes and they are sucked into the mansion.  

  

They find themselves standing in the foyer of the mansion, the double doors leading out slam shut behind them. Looks like they’ll have to find a way out…

  
  

**Getting Home**

There are 7 books hidden across the mansion w/ large letters on their spines, 6 of the books spell out the word ESCAPE, the 7th book, with the letter R on it is held by the mummified remains of a pair of individuals. These individuals also have a piece of the stabilization mechanism in one of their pockets. When the party escapes the mansion, these corpses will also come with them if they haven’t found the piece. 

  

When the party finds all 6 proper books, assembles them and speaks the word ESCAPE in the foyer in front of the double doors, they are immediately sucked back out of the book and into the infinite library. 

  

The other books are in the following rooms: 

E:  M3, Library

S: M11, Laboratory

C: M15, Bedroom

A: M5, Study

P: M13, The Chained Library

E: M17, Alchemical Lab

  

Change to M16: Balcony & M9: Arboretum

  

The arboretum in area 9 is encased in glass, as you would expect, there is a dark miasma outside the glass, maybe 3-4 feet away. On the outside of the glass, there appears to be something that’s shaped like a corpse, looks like there’s a book under the body, grasped by one hand. 

  

The corpse isn’t accessible from this area, only from M16, the balcony. There is a second corpse here, hanging by 1 foot from a rope directly above the first. When the second corpse is disturbed, it breaks off at the knee and falls onto the ceiling of the arboretum…

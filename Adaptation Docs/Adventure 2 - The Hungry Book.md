The next adventure starts after the party returns to the Infinite Library. When the party is ready, Miirym will bring them a book bound in wolf fur, she claims she heard some rumbling sounds coming from the book…almost like it was hungry or something. 

When the party opens the book, a couple bones fall to the floor, seemingly out of nowhere. When someone reads it…it animates and attacks them, hopefully killing the party pretty quickly and swallowing them. When a party member is eaten, they arrive in the adventure…

The party wakes up in the middle of the night at a campsite, they appear to have been camping here for the night. 

There is a nearby Village, [[Amberdune]], where this adventure takes place. When the party gets bored and/or are unsure how to progress, introduce the threat: a tribe of werefolk have taken up residence near [[Amberdune]] and are slowly leeching the village of its resources. 

We introduce these werefolk by means of an ambush combat. **DC20** perception check or be surprised. Combat is w/ **A Wererat & 3 Giant rats**. The Wererat serves as a leader for the rats, hiding in the underbrush and attacking with a crossbow. He attempts to flee if 2 of the 3 rats are killed or if he is attacked. 

When the party arrives in town, folks are going about their day but are suspicious of the party…considering a few folks have gone missing recently. 

There is a traveling merchant here that has been here for a little too long…specifically he is acting disoriented and is unsure of where he's supposed to be going. 

*Truth: he was sold one of the pieces of the alignment grid by the true owner. The owner was infected by the werefolk and went feral, forgetting his task. He still has a small wooden box in his possessions, which has a cutout for the grid piece. There is a note: Hide this in the village where no one will find it, then figure out who is turning the locals, that's how you'll return home.*

**Adventure Resolution:** Find out why the townsfolk have gone missing, who is making them go missing, and either put an end to it or convince them to stop. 

	Why: The tribe of Werefolk are attempting to add to their numbers as they seek refuge here. 
	Who: Some of the younger members of the tribe are doing it unsafely & their leader Korvala doesn't know how to keep them in check. 
	Make them stop: Propose something convincing to Korvala or kill her subordinates & convince her to leave the area. 

When the adventure is resolved, the party leaves the story just like they entered, they are regurgitated by the furry book, accompanied by the merchant, who still doesn't have all his memories...

The Stabilization Mechanism piece is held by Mushika, the wererat that ambushes the party several times. Korvala knows he has it, but not what it's for or where he got it from.

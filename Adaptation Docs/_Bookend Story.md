- We’re going to use Miirym as our main plot device, she’s cool as heck
- After the party goofs off a bit, have Miirym show up and tell everyone what’s going on
- she’s named this room ‘The infinite library’, as it is constantly shifting and changing, sections of the room appear and disappear randomly, 
- Miirym doesn’t know how to get out right now, but he thinks he might be able to figure it out with the party's help. 
    
This isn’t the first group to arrive, she’s sent some other groups into books to investigate. She doesn’t know what magic is creating these mini-planes, but he believes it’s tied to the magic that’s keeping him here & keeping the library the way it is. 

The Truth: 
The library is interdimensional, but malfunctioning. There are X number of pocket planes that have pieces of the stabilization mechanism hidden in them. Once the mechanism is re-assembled, the library returns to its indented configuration & the party may leave w/ Mirrym. 

The Library’s home is in an evil Wizard’s compound. When the party escapes with Miirym, they’ll navigate this final area & come face-to-face with the Wizard, who attempts to turn Miirym against the party. 

The lingering question:
Why are the pieces of the stabilization mechanism hidden? Why was it broken in the first place? Maybe we end up changing the ending as I figure that out.**

-Obviously we need to figure out what is going on with the other folks that went into the first book, and I need to work on tying together the subsequent adventures.

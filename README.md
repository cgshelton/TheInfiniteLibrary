# The Infinite Library
 An experimental repo to store & track a D&D Campaign w/ Obsidian

**Goal:** Learn markdown & how to organize my thoughts w/ obsidian, so I can store them easily w/ github. 

This campaign is a reinterpretation of [**Candlekeep Mysteries**](https://archive.org/details/candlekeep-mysteries), a 5e module. The initial set of notes will be rough, but I'll refine them over time so they can serve as a reference. 

**Usage:** open the contents of this repo with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to view links, etc. properly.
